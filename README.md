# Sign Language Digit Prediction

This project aims to predict sign language digits using machine learning algorithms. Sign languages are a crucial form of communication for people who are deaf or hard of hearing, and this project focuses on recognizing hand gestures used to convey the meaning of numbers from 0 to 9 in American Sign Language (ASL). We have utilized logistic regression and a two-layer neural network to classify the sign language digit images provided in the dataset. The dataset used in this project is the Sign Language Digits Dataset, which was created by students from Turkey Ankara Ayrancı Anadolu High School and is available on GitHub.
